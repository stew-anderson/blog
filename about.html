	  <p>I’m a strategic technology leader with more than 20 years of experience in software and engineering. I kicked off my career as a hands-on developer and have transitioned into leadership roles over the last decade. This journey has given me a solid technical foundation, along with the skills to scale teams, drive transformation, and align technology with business goals.</p>

	  <p>I’ve successfully led global, remote-first engineering teams through significant changes, streamlining technology stacks, implementing agile and DevOps practices, and empowering teams across various regions. My leadership approach is all about collaboration and mentorship, ensuring that both people and platforms evolve together.</p>

	  <p>I’m passionate about innovation and community. Whether it’s promoting operational AI adoption, developing cloud-native open-source solutions, or fostering developer engagement, I thrive on creating spaces where technology, processes, and culture unite to make a lasting impact.</p>
