Too often, tech decisions are framed as purely technical. In reality, every tech decision has business consequences. Throughout my career I've interacted with multiple technical teams that feel they "*have no impact on revenue*", as they are not "*customer facing*", in truth their work is a vital component in the process that has a far greater impact on revenue, as much as those customer facing roles.

### The hidden business layer
If we consider a simple decision in a project, which front end framework to use, either [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://react.dev/), for example. When developers make this decision, they believe they are doing it for the developer experience or performance, but beneath this surface are further implications, comparing these:

| React business implications																	| Vue business implications |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Larger talent pool<br />*Faster hiring, more competitive salaries*							| Smaller but growing talent pool<br />*Higher salary premiums, longer search times* |
| Meta's backing & ecosystem<br />*Corporate stability, extensive tooling*						| Independent governance<br />*Less corporate influence, more community-driven* |
| Higher enterprise adoption<br />*Easier stakeholder buy-in for large projects*				| Strong in mid-market<br />*May require more justification for enterprise clients* |
| Steeper learning curve<br />*Higher onboarding costs, longer ramp-up time* 					| Gentler learning curve<br />*Faster junior developer productivity* |
| More complex state management<br />*Higher maintenance overhead, more architectural decisions*| Simpler architecture<br />*Lower long-term maintenance costs, faster feature delivery* |
| Larger ecosystem<br />*More third-party options, but decision fatigue* 						| Focused, curated ecosystem<br />*Less choice paralysis, but potential vendor lock-in* |

Ok, that table will probably have raised a few eyebrows any frontend team, but you can see in this example how a straightforward technical decision for a framework looks more like a decision about **hiring strategy, operational costs and competitive positioning**. This example is just one lens, stepping back you'll see the technology is the surface layer and illustrates a technical decision almost always hides a business layer beneath it.

### The business aspects of every tech decision
Every tech decision carries a business abstraction: costs, risks, speed, customer impact, talent, and strategic alignment.

1. **Cost structure:** Nothing in this life is free...Open-source libraries can look free until you hit integrations complexity, security patching or support overhead or latency adds up - what is the long-term cost?
2. **Risk profile:** Choosing cutting edge technology isn't just about performance, it's about betting product roadmaps on unproven stability
3. **Time to market/speed:** Choosing a complex but "perfect" solution may slow shipping, while a simpler one gets you to market faster.
4. **Customer experience (CX):** So often tech is the front line of your customer experience – clunky, unreliable interfaces cost you revenue and loyalty, customers don't see the tech decision, they feel them
5. **Organisational capability / Talent and Culture:** Your technology stack defines your hiring profile, each choice shaped not just what you build but who you can hire to build it.
6. **Strategic alignment:** tech decisions both open and close future business paths, but can you pivot when the market shifts, can you scale when demand spikes – are you helping the business achieve its strategic goals.

### When technical debt becomes business debt
This is a two-way street, and the issue of technical debt is not just the burden of the Tech teams, it impacts business agility. Similarly, as demonstrated above, every short cut ignoring, or adding to tech debt only creates compound interest on future business decisions.

Picture a start-up that chooses a monolithic architecture for speed and getting releases out, 18 months later they find themselves at a crossroads losing bigger enterprise deals because to add single-sign-on means rebuilding their entire auth system :grimacing:. The "technical" architecture just became the bottleneck for their go-to-market strategy.

### Speaking the language of impact
**For tech leaders:** speak the language of business impact. Don't frame decisions only in terms of architecture or tooling. They aren't just about throughput or latency, they're about customer satisfaction, revenue enablement or risk reduction.

**For business leaders:** don't treat tech as a black box. Be part of the conversation. Ask how a choice affects ROI, risk, and growth.

### Making better decisions
Next time the team debates a technical choice, the question to ask is "*how does each option help advance the business objectives?*" Who knows you may find the "inferior" tech solution is actually a superior business choice – or vice versa.

The goal isn't to let business concerns dictate every tech decision, but to make these trade-offs consciously. Sometimes the "expensive" technical choice is worth it for developer productivity, system reliability, or competitive advantage. The key is having full visibility into the business implications of each option. We're not just building software, we're building businesses, and every line of code either moves it forward or holds it back.

A technology choice is a business choice. If not seen in that light, you're not just making a tech mistake, you're making a business one.

:point_right: When was the last time you chose the "technically best" option, only to realise it wasn't the best decision for the business?
