My career started as most tech careers do: with code. I was a developer, learning frameworks, debugging until the early hours, turning caffeine to code, and focusing on solving problems one line at a time :sunglasses: .

But as I grew from mid-level to senior to lead developer, I discovered the most challenging issues weren't in the codebases or frameworks. They were in how people, process, and technology came together.

## From developer to leader
Head of Engineering was the turning point. I inherited a team split across multiple technologies, each with its own practices and silos. It was holding us back and slowing us down.

My focus shifted: rather than just writing code, I had to consider how we deliver as a team. The transition wasn't easy, but moving from fragmented sub-teams into a unified single tech stack changed everything. It gave us speed, clarity, and a shared sense of purpose

## Why I'm writing this blog
That experience, and many lessons since, convinced me that the journey from code to boardroom is one of the most important shifts in a tech career. 

I'm not a CTO (yet). But I know where I am headed. Writing here is my way of:
* Clarify my thoughts by reviewing lessons learned.
* Pass on to others who are making the same changes.
* Starting conversations about what actually goes into leading with technology.

## What you can expect to find here
In this blog, I'll explore:
* Technology strategy: making choices that will stand the test of time beyond today's project.
* Leadership lessons: what actually goes into building high-performing teams.
* Business alignment: why every technical decision has business consequences.
* Personal reflection: what I'm learning as I keep growing on this journey.

I'm calling this blog Code to Boardroom because that's the path I'm walking: from developer, to engineering leader, and eventually to technology executive.
