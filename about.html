	  <p>I'm a strategic technology leader with more than 20 years of experience in software and engineering. I kicked off my career as a hands-on developer and have transitioned into leadership roles over the last decade. This journey has given me a solid technical foundation, along with the skills to scale teams, drive transformation, and align technology with business goals.</p>

	  <p>I've successfully led global, remote-first engineering teams through significant changes, streamlining technology stacks, implementing agile and DevOps practices, and empowering teams across various regions. My leadership approach is all about collaboration and mentorship, ensuring that both people and platforms evolve together.</p>

    <p>Of course, life isn't all about technology. When I'm not working at the desk I channel my energy into music and the great outdoors. Playing guitar keeps me creative, while mountain biking challenges me to stay focused and push boundaries - both of which influence how I approach leadership and problem-solving.</p>
